## The Model

Since the deep models take a long time to run and often require a lot of computer power, we will just detail where you might use a deep learning model in your own work. 

In this section, detail a classification task you might use a deep learning model for:
  - What are the class labels? (i.e. what are the groups?)
  - What would you use to predict the labels? Explain how text is involved in the prediction.
  - What type of model would you use (RNN, CNN, mix of both)?
  - How many layers would you include in your model?
  - What type of layers do you think might be effective to help you predict your classes?
