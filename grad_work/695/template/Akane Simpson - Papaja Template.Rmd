This is the initial line for an introduction to the paper. In this paper I will seek to analyze and document an new discovery about our current society.

# Literature Review
This is the first line for a literature review.

@helm2022examining opening line says, "The online presence of incels, or involuntary celibates, has been an increasing security concern for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in recent years..." while @o2022exploration suports this claim "...several violent incidents have been linked to this community, which suggests that incel communities may resemble other ideologically motivated extremist groups".

# Methods
In this section I will talk about how I planned my study by calculating the required sample size, the data that I was able to find or generate, list and discuss how this relates to answering our hypothesis or whatever.

## Participants
This study should have no participants needed.

## Procedure
The study will use a step by step procedure to identify, measure and observe interactions by users on the internet.

## Measures
The measures that we identify are language and sentiment in these online posts.

## Analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.
In our analysis we will see if there is a established connection that helps prove or disprove our prior hypothesis.
